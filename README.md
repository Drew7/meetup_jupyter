# Abstracts of presentations

## From IPython to Jupyter

The talk is about how the attempt to make the standard Python console better lead to
a new ecosystem for interactive computing, with support of multiple languages, ...
and also how this relates to a big money and (at least) one legend programmer.

## Jupyter Notebook: Architecture and Usage Practice

The talk is about the main principles of Jupyter notebooks and how these principles
influence the practice of Jupyter use. The task of the presentation is to give some
understanding on how the different features of the Jupyter platform are related and how
use the Jupyter efficiently in everyday data processing tasks.

## Jupyter Notebook: between interactive document and specialized web application

Jupyter Notebooks (previously IPython Notebooks) has already become the product of choice
for many scientific and education projects, ranging from particle physics and cosmology
to data science and all kinds or tutorials. For majority of notebook users, it works like
(semi-)interactive document: one may combine descriptive text (with Markdown formatting),
executable code, and computation results, including plots and images and save the notebook
for future non-interactive work. On the other hand, Jupyter notebooks support various kinds
of interactive widgets, ranging from geographic maps to complex dashboards, resulting in
specialized web interface. In my talk, I will explain how these two kinds of usage are
reflected in the notebook architecture and discuss how to select the approach for your
product.
